## How to Play
- When you open the game, you'll see a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns to place their respective symbol (X or O) on the grid by clicking on an empty cell.
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
- If all cells are filled and no player wins, the game ends in a draw.
